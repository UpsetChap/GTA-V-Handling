# GTA-V-Handling

GTA V Handling, with 4 different variations as a showcase. There are 4 versions of 4 different types of vehicle used, 16 total. Certain values have been changed to have similar performance for each type, with the same wheels being driven for comparitive purposes.

BLISTA, ASTEROPE2, BALLER, BANSHEE. Quite close to regular GTA but with reduced grip, breaking and anti-roll.

KANJO, PREMIER, CAVALCADE, COQUETTE. Similar values to the above, but with increased gravity and inertia so the cars feel less floaty. Also the anti-roll force is removed or lowered.

PRAIRIE, INTRUDER, LANDSTALKER, SPECTER. A preview for my own full project, again with increased gravity but also "extra soft surface suspension". Increased inertia, lower suspension compared to the above.

RHAPSODY, PRIMO, GRESLEY, RAPIDGT. An homage to the excellent 'Drive V' (https://github.com/Weilher420/DriveV_Fivem_port), does not have increased gravity but has greatly increased inertia values alongside alt suspension.
